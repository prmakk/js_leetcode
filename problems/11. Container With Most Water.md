## Problem Description

```
You are given an integer array height of length n.

There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
```

## Code

Typescript Code:

```ts
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;
    let maxArea = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        let width = right - left;
        let leftHeight = height[left];
        let rightHeight = height[right];
        let minHeight = Math.min(leftHeight, rightHeight);
        const area = minHeight * width;
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

        if (leftHeight <= rightHeight) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```
